            <li>Patrusheva Violetta</li>
            <!-- Q2-->
            <li>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your portfolio site? Describe the version of
you that it is about. What is the audience you are addressing? What type of structure did you
choose to implement?
</li>
            <p>This project presents a futuristic vision of myself, imagined as I might be in ten years. Rather than approaching the site with traditional seriousness, I conceptualized it as an immersive experience akin to a game. The intention was to create a website that embodies the persona of a hacker, evoking the distinctive style and atmosphere of Cyberpunk 2077. By integrating elements of hacking with my philosophical perspective on Buddhism, I aimed to craft a unique narrative that reflects both technological fascination and spiritual contemplation. The audience is prospective clients, employers, and peers interested in my work in security, software development, and system administration.</p>
            
            <!-- Q3-->
            <li>Inspiration: State 3 professional portfolio sites (not advices articles or portfolio templates) that
have inspired you when creating your website. What did you learn from them?</li>

            <p>While I did not specifically reference professional portfolio sites, I drew considerable inspiration from a range of websites across different domains:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/nl/en/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077 Official Site</a>: My fascination with the Cyberpunk aesthetic greatly influenced the design of my portfolio. The site's use of striking, neon color schemes, audacious and provocative text, and dynamic visual elements served as a significant inspiration. These features aligned with my intention to create a site that evokes a similar visual and thematic experience.</li>

                <li><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/24089212-Website-for-Design-Studio" target="_blank">Website for Design Studio on Dribbble</a>: I was particularly impressed by the authorâ€™s innovative use of color combinations. This approach informed my own design choices, as I aimed to achieve a harmonious and engaging visual presentation in my project.</li>

                <li><a href="https://www.europapark.de/de" target="_blank">Europa Park Official Site</a>: Although my initial search for inspiration led me to this site, its emphasis on user accessibility and responsive design provided valuable insights. I applied these best practices to ensure that my portfolio is both accessible and optimized for various devices.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Q4-->
            <li>Accessibility</li>
            <p>My portfolio site has been designed with accessibility in mind, incorporating several key practices to ensure it is usable by a broad audience, including those with disabilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Alt Text for Images: All images on the site include descriptive alt text to ensure they are accessible to screen readers.</li>
                <li>Text Enlargement Buttons: I added two buttons that allow users to increase the text size on the website. This feature assists users with visual impairments, making the content easier to read and navigate.</li>
                <li>Color Contrast: High contrast between text and background colors ensures readability for users with visual impairments.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Q5-->
            <li>Usability</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Common CSS File: To avoid the issue of having multiple CSS files for different pages and encountering errors when making changes, I consolidated all CSS into a single common file. This simplifies maintenance and ensures consistency across the site.</li>
                    <li>Navigation Menu: I added a navigation menu to enhance the functionality of the site. This feature allows users to easily navigate between different sections of the site, improving overall usability.</li>
                    <li>Responsive Design: I ensured that the website's layout adapts to different screen sizes by aligning the navigation menu with tablet and desktop versions. However, due to time constraints, the mobile version was not completed.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <!-- Q6-->
            <li>Learning</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML Forms: I learned how to create an HTML form for a booking system by studying the basics from W3Schools. This was crucial for implementing a feature that allows users to book tickets in advance.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript Styling: To improve my JavaScript skills, I followed a course video that demonstrated text styling methods. This helped me understand how to apply styles dynamically using JavaScript. The technique is illustrated in the video tutorial (JavaScript Styling).</li>
                    <li>CSS Frameworks: To address my lack of experience with CSS styling, I explored popular CSS frameworks and decided to use Bootstrap to design a booking button. This experience helped me understand the principles of web responsiveness and the use of rem units for scaling. I learned about this from a video tutorial (Bootstrap Framework).</li>
                </ul>
            
            <!-- Q7-->
            <li>Evaluation I</li>
            <p>Successful Aspects: One of the most successful aspects of the project was the implementation of a common header, navigation, and footer for multiple HTML pages. This approach streamlined the design process and improved the site's functionality. Additionally, integrating responsive design elements ensured that the site is user-friendly across different devices.</p>
            
            <!-- Q8-->
            <li>Evaluation II</li>
            <p>Areas for Improvement: While the site effectively uses a common CSS file and responsive design, there were areas for improvement. Specifically, the mobile version of the navigation menu was not completed due to time constraints. In the future, I would allocate more time to ensure that all versions of the site are fully responsive and functional.</p>
